This file containes dated notes based on code changes, testing and learnings throughout this project.

Thursday, March 27:
    Began work, have never coded in python before so researching sockets at: https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/socket.html

    1. Created server socket using AF_INET family, and SOCK_STREAM type. This socket was bound to proxyHost and proxyPort IP and port number. The listen function is then used to begin listening on that socket.
    2. Added code to accept a connection from a client, and recieve a message. Tested this using telnet, along with the example request below and it seems to function correctly. Also updated comments explaining how functions work.
