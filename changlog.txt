    Began work, have never coded in python before so researching sockets at: https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/socket.html

    1. Created server socket using AF_INET family, and SOCK_STREAM type. This socket was bound to proxyHost and proxyPort IP and port number. The listen function is then used to begin listening on that socket.
